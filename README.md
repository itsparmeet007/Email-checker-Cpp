#ðŸ“§ Email Username Validator in C++

ðŸ“Œ Description
This project is a simple Email Username Validation program written in C++.
It checks whether the username part of an email (before the @ symbol) follows specific rules.

I created this project as part of my C++ learning journey â€” understanding the logic and functions, not just copying code.
